 Intersectionality is described by intersectionaljustice.org as the greater discrimination caused by the interactions of systems of inequality. This means that to achieve our goals we need to validate everyoneâ€™s struggles, including the unique experiences of those that do not have privilege and are frequently discriminated against and marginalized. It is important to acknowledge that access to menstrual, reproductive, and sexual health services means different things to different people. </p>

      <p class= "tst"> For example, it may be easier for some to go to a facility and receive treatment, or they may experience a higher quality of care compared to another person. Often this is due to prejudice or stigma, resulting in a disparity in the quality of care and ability to receive care physically and/or financially. To achieve equality among all people, we must accept the reality of privilege and intersectionality. This initiative, among many others, seeks ways to be equitable and inclusive in their advocacy.
